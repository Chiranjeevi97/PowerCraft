# PowerCraft
Accurate Electrical System Mod

- Download and install the latest version of Minetest Game.

- Clone or download this repository onto your local machine.

- Now go ahead and install it like any other Minetest mod. If you are confused check out this link: https://wiki.minetest.net/Mods

- If Powercraft is still in a ZIP file, extract the folder inside to somewhere on the computer.

- Make sure that when you open the folder, you can directly find README.md in the listing.

- Open up the Minetest mods folder - usually /mods/. If you see the minetest or folder inside of that, that is your mod folder instead.

- Copy the PowerCraft folder into the mods folder.

- Don't like some parts of PowerCraft? Open up the PowerCraft folder and delete the files containing the block you don't want. If you didn't want burger, for example, all you have to do is delete the burger.lua file and that will no longer be available in your world.

- There are no dependencies - it will work right after installing!
